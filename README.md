## üè† Airbnb Clone Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

3. **Database Administrator (DBA)**
   Manages the database systems, including schema design, query optimization, data backups, and security. Ensures data integrity and availability.

4. **DevOps Engineer**
   Builds and manages the CI/CD pipeline, automates deployments, monitors infrastructure, and ensures system scalability and reliability using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions.

5. **UI/UX Designer**
   Designs intuitive interfaces and improves user experience by creating wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs. Collaborates with developers to bring designs to life.

6. **Project Manager**
   Coordinates the project‚Äôs timeline, team communication, task assignments, and ensures the project stays aligned with business goals. Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

7. **QA Engineer**
   Responsible for ensuring the quality of the product through automated and manual testing. Identifies bugs, verifies fixes, and maintains testing documentation.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities

1. **Users**

   * `id` (Primary Key)
   * `name`
   * `email`
   * `password`
   * `role` (e.g., guest, host)

2. **Properties**

   * `id` (Primary Key)
   * `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   * `title`
   * `location`
   * `price_per_night`

3. **Bookings**

   * `id` (Primary Key)
   * `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   * `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)
   * `check_in_date`
   * `check_out_date`

4. **Reviews**

   * `id` (Primary Key)
   * `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   * `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)
   * `rating`
   * `comment`

5. **Payments**

   * `id` (Primary Key)
   * `booking_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)
   * `amount`
   * `payment_date`
   * `status`

### Entity Relationships

* A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.
* A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
* A **Booking** is associated with one **Property** and one **User**.
* A **Review** is given by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
* A **Payment** is linked to a specific **Booking**.

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management**
   Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports role-based access control, distinguishing between guests and property hosts.

2. **Property Management**
   Hosts can list properties with detailed information such as title, description, location, price, and images. They can also update or remove listings as needed.

3. **Booking System**
   Guests can search for available properties, select dates, and make bookings. The system ensures no double-booking and tracks booking history for both users and hosts.

4. **Review & Rating System**
   Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they‚Äôve stayed in. This feedback helps other users make informed decisions and encourages quality service from hosts.

5. **Payment Integration**
   Secure payment processing for bookings is handled within the app. It tracks payment status, ensures proper invoicing, and confirms successful transactions.

6. **Admin Dashboard (Optional)**
   Admins can monitor user activities, manage content, and ensure compliance with platform policies. This feature adds an extra layer of control and transparency.

## üîê API Security

Security is a top priority in this project to protect sensitive user data, ensure trust, and maintain system integrity. The following key measures are implemented:

1. **Authentication**
   Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) is used to verify the identity of users accessing the API. This ensures that only registered and logged-in users can perform certain actions.

2. **Authorization**
   Role-based access control restricts access to specific endpoints. For example, only hosts can manage property listings, and only authenticated users can make bookings or post reviews.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   Prevents abuse of the API through excessive requests (e.g., brute force attacks). This improves application performance and reliability.

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), maintaining data integrity and system protection.

5. **Secure Payment Handling**
   Payments are processed through trusted third-party services (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) with secure protocols, protecting financial data and ensuring compliance with PCI-DSS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It automates testing, building, and deploying code. CI ensures changes are tested automatically; CD handles deploying those changes to production or staging environments.

### Why It‚Äôs Important

CI/CD pipelines increase development speed and code quality by catching issues early through automated testing. They ensure smooth deployments, reduce production bugs, and promote collaboration by maintaining a consistent workflow.

### Tools Used

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like running tests, linting code, and deploying the application.
* **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production using containerization.
* **Heroku / AWS / Netlify** *(optional)*: Hosting platforms for continuous deployment of backend or frontend services.
